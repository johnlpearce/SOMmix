# sommix
The R package sommix provides a collection of functions in the R Project for Statistical Computing that support application of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm for analyses of complex, highdimensional data. The development of sommix is motivated by environmental epidemiology settings where exposure assessment and examination of health effects often involves multiple risk factors that are highly skewed and present strong correlation structures. The sommix package includes functions for examining variables independently, exploration of underlying data structure, and application and evaluation of self-organizied maps (SOMs). Illustrative vignettes are provided.
